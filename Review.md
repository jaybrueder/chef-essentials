# Feedback for new Chef-Essentials training

## Introduction

This document serves a place for my thoughts and my feedback on the Chef-Essentials training.

## Overall

I think it make the entry to the Chef world easier and more accessible. If I could change two things, it would be removing Git and Test Kitchen and add a bit more about the inner working of the Chef-Client and the Bootstrap process.

This would keep the focus on Chef and allow to create a separate training that could concentrate on the perfect "Chef Cookbook Workflow".

I also included specific feedback for each slide deck. If a slide deck is not included I did not find anything wrong with it.

## 1 Intro
- Test Kitchen is a valuable topic for every cookbook developer. However, I think it may be a bit too much for a 2 day training as it adds another layer of complexity that could be handled in a separate "Chef Cookbook Workflow" training
- I like the progression from doing things locally first and then moving towards using a full setup with Chef Server.
 
## 2 Resources
- Again, I like starting out with Chef apply to show that you can do stuff on your local workstation as well

## 3  Cookbook
- Git may be a bit too much for a 2 day Chef training. I would also want to move that into a "Chef Cookbook Workflow" training. Also, the info that is here about Git is a bit scarce. 

## 4 Chef-Client
- I miss the "What happens during the Chef-Client-Run" explanation

## 5 Testing
- There is a lot of content compressed into these slides. I mention again that I would move this into a separate "Chef Cookbook Workflow" training to allow enough room to teach this topic
- I would also say that here is more on how Test-Kitchen works in here than there is content about how the Chef-Client works in the previous slide decks
- Slide 47: "Where do Tests Live?‚Äù should be "Where do Tests live?" with lower case L.

## 7 Desired state
- I never heard about calling it the "Angry Squid" before but I will use it from now on as I describes it perfectly :D
